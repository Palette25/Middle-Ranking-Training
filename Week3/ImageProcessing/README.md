# README for ImageReader

### File Structure
```
├── lib
├── src
├── ImageProcessorTest.java
├── ImplementImageIO.java
├── ImplementImageProcessor.java
├── README.md
├── build.xml
```

### Use method
	1. I have finished the build.xml in this update package, so you just need to 
	   input ' ant ' in terminal and run this ImageReader
	2. As for junit, I include the test function into the build.xml, so you just 
		to enter ' ant test ' in terminal and run ImageProcessorTest.
